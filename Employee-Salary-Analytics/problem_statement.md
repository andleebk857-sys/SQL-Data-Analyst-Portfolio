# Employee Salary Analytics

## Business Problem
A company wants to analyze employee salary data to understand:
- Which employees earn the most in each department
- Whether employees are paid above or below department averages
- How salary budgets are distributed across departments
- Which managers handle the highest salary budgets

This analysis helps management make better compensation and budgeting decisions.
